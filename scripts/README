Kconfig tools

==============================

You can use this in your kconfig based build system but it may need changes to the code to make it work for your project. This is just a simple implementation.


Build:
-------------------
1. Navigate to the root directory of this repository.
2. Run 'make' to build all the tools:

$ make

To build a specific tool, run 'make <tool_name>'.

   For example, to build only the 'conf' tool, run:

$ make conf

Clean Instructions:
-------------------
To start fresh you can run:
$ make clean
