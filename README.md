# buildqnx

## Overview

This project provides a set of scripts and configurations to build and run QNX within various virtual machines, including QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware, and QVM. It aims to simplify the process of setting up a QNX development environment or testing QNX applications.

## Features

*   **Multi-hypervisor Support:** Build QNX images for QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware, and QVM.
*   **Configurable QNX Image:** Utilizes Kconfig for flexible configuration of the QNX image, including architecture, CPU, RAM, networking, and security features.
*   **Automated Build Process:** Scripts to generate default configurations and build the QNX image using `mkqnximage`.
*   **Interactive User Management:** A command-line tool to easily add, edit, and manage users within the QNX image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project relies on a few external tools. Please ensure they are installed on your system.

*   **`mkqnximage`:** This tool is required to build the QNX image. It must be installed, licensed via the QNX Software Center, and available in your systemâ€™s `$PATH`.
*   **Python 3:** The build scripts are written in Python 3.
*   **Virtualization Software:** You will need one of the supported virtualization platforms to run the generated image:
    *   QEMU
    *   VirtualBox
    *   VMware (Workstation or Player)
    *   QVM (no idea what is this)

### Installation Instructions

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git build-essential python3 qemu-system
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S base-devel git python qemu-desktop
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf update && sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf install @development-tools git python3 qemu-kvm
```

**Note on VMware:** VMware products are proprietary and must be downloaded from the official [VMware website](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion).

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xaonfc/buildqnx
    cd buildqnx
    ```

2.  (Optional) Generate a default configuration:
    ```bash
    make defconfig
    ```

3.  (Optional) Configure the QNX image interactively:
    ```bash
    make menuconfig
    ```
    (This will automatically clone and build the necessary kconfig tools if they are not present.)

### Building the QNX Image

To build the QNX image based on your `.config` file:

```bash
make
```

This will execute the `mkqnximage` tool with the parameters specified in your `.config`.

### Managing Users

To interactively add, edit, or delete users in your QNX configuration:

```bash
make edit-users
```

### Cleaning the Project

To remove build artifacts (contents of `local/` and `output/`):

```bash
make clean
```

To remove build artifacts and the `.config` file, and the `kbuild-standalone` directory:

```bash
make distclean
```

## Configuration

The project uses a `Kconfig` file to define various options for the QNX image. You can configure these options using `make menuconfig` or by directly editing the `.config` file.
